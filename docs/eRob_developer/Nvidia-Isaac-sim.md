# 1. Introduction to Isaac Sim
Although we provided a brief introduction to Isaac Sim in previous notes, we will discuss it again here (primarily translating the introduction from the official documentation).

NVIDIA Omniverse Isaac Sim is a robotics simulation toolkit designed for the NVIDIA Omniverse platform. Isaac Sim boasts numerous key features tailored for building virtual robotic worlds and conducting experiments. It provides researchers and professionals with tools and workflows to create robust, high-precision physical simulations and synthetic datasets. Additionally, Isaac Sim supports other applications such as navigation and control through ROS/ROS2. Isaac Sim can simulate data from sensors like RGB-D cameras, LiDAR, and IMU, and it provides ground truth data. Below is the running interface of Isaac Sim.

#2.Isaac Sim System Architecture
The system architecture of Isaac Sim is illustrated in the diagram below. As you can see, Isaac Sim supports the import of various models and environment files. USD files can be naturally opened directly (since the entire Omniverse is developed based on USD), while other file types, such as Onshape files, URDF (ROS) files, and MJCF files, are converted by their respective Importers.

Isaac Sim is built upon Omniverse Kit, and then Isaac Sim itself is developed on top of it. There are different modes tailored for various environments. For example:

Local Desktop Environment: This is the most common mode of Isaac Sim, suitable for standard desktop setups.
Headless Mode: Designed for network environments and remote control scenarios. Headless mode refers to systems that lack display devices, keyboards, or mice. In many cases, servers operate in Headless mode and are controlled via remote connections.
In addition to these modes, there are numerous Extensions built on top of Isaac Sim that provide various functionalities, such as:

- ROS Bridge Extension: Enables interaction with ROS/ROS2, facilitating navigation, control, and other applications.
Synthetic Data Recorder Extension: Allows for the saving of synthetic datasets, which is invaluable for training and testing machine learning models.
Moreover, Isaac Sim can simulate data from sensors like RGB-D cameras, LiDAR, and IMU, and it provides ground truth data for accurate simulation results. Below is an example of Isaac Sim's running interface:
